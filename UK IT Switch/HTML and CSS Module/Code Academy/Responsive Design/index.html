          As I luckily inherited some early inheritence, I became obssesed with
          investing. I have committed to many principles of these books.
          Including but not limited to: dollar-cost-averaging; 3-6 month
          emergency fund; Mutual fund investing; reading balance sheets and
          eventually property investing.
